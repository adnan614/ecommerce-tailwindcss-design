         Due to have no stock of your product (s), we firstly cancel your order & back your principal balance to your wallet (REFUND BALANCE). If you have a intention, you can use this balance in any kinds of orders. Otherwise, we'll refund your balance within 7 to 15 working days in your desired channel. But WABMart never pay any kind of service charge which normally need to cash out.
